# Design Decisions

## Architecture Overview

### Component Structure
- **GitMonitor**: Core class handling git operations
- **DiscordClient**: Handles Discord webhook communication
- **ConfigManager**: Manages application configuration
- **Main Script**: Orchestrates the components

### Key Decisions

1. **Python as Primary Language**
   - Decision: Use Python for implementation
   - Rationale: 
     - Excellent git integration via GitPython
     - Strong Discord webhook libraries
     - Cross-platform compatibility
     - Easy deployment and maintenance

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Decision: Use JSON for configuration
   - Rationale:
     - Human-readable format
     - Easy to modify without code changes
     - No security concerns for local deployment
   - **Best Practices Implemented:**
     - Atomic saves: Config is written to a temp file and atomically replaced to prevent corruption.
     - Automatic backup: Previous config is backed up before each save.
     - Versioning: Config includes a version field for future migration.
     - Validation: Config is validated on load and repaired or restored from backup if needed.
     - Recovery: If config is corrupted, the app will attempt to restore from backup or use defaults.

3. **Monitoring Strategy**
   - Decision: Polling-based monitoring
   - Rationale:
     - Simpler implementation
     - More reliable across different OS versions
     - Configurable intervals
     - Lower resource usage

4. **Error Handling**
   - Decision: Graceful degradation with logging
   - Rationale:
     - Maintains uptime despite temporary issues
     - Provides debugging trail
     - Allows for future monitoring integration

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Consider webhook rate limiting
   - Plan for multi-repository support
   - Evaluate performance with large repositories

2. **Security**
   - Monitor for sensitive data in commits
   - Consider adding authentication for configuration changes
   - Plan for secure credential management
